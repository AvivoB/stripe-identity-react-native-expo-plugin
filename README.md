# Stripe Identity React Native SDK

Stripe Identity enables online businesses to securely verify the identities of users around the world. Robust identity verification helps prevent fraud, simplify compliance, and increase trust. Stripe will use biometric technology (on images of you and your IDs) and other data sources. With the Stripe Identity React Native SDK, you can confidently verify the authenticity of ID documents from over 33 countries in your React Native application.

## Getting started

Get started with our [ðŸ“š integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/identity) and [example project](#run-the-example-app).

> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [changelog](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-identity-react-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

Install the SDK by running:

```sh
npm install stripe-identity-react-native
or
yarn add stripe-identity-react-native
```

### iOS

For iOS, run `pod install` in your `ios` directory to ensure that you also install the required native dependencies. Android doesnâ€™t require any additional steps.

Set up camera authorization

Stripe Identity requires access to the deviceâ€™s camera to capture identity documents. To enable your app to request camera permissions:

- Open your projectâ€™s Info.plist in Xcode.
- Add the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key.
- Add a string value that explains to your users why your app requires camera permissions, something like:
  > This app uses the camera to take a picture of your identity documents.

### Requirements

The SDK uses TypeScript features available in Babel version `7.9.0` and above.
Alternatively use the `plugin-transform-typescript` plugin in your project.

#### Android

- Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above

#### iOS

- Compatible with apps targeting iOS 13.0 or above.

## Stripe Identity SDK initialization

To initialize Stripe Identity SDK in your React Native app, use the `useStripeIdentity` hook in the screen where you want to use it.

First you need a server-side endpoint to [create the VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions/create), then you can send a POST request to create verification session:

```ts
const fetchVerificationSessionParams = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fetch(
      `${YOUR_SERVER_BASE_URL}/create-verification-session`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: {},
      }
    );
    const json = await data.json();
    return json;
  } catch (e) {
    return {};
  }
};
```

Once you get options you can use `useStripeIdentity` passing fetchOptions to it.

```tsx
// HomeScreen.tsx
import { useStripeIdentity } from 'stripe-identity-react-native';
import logo from './assets/logo.png';

function HomeScreen() {
  const fetchOptions = async () => {
    const response = await fetchVerificationSessionParams();

    return {
      sessionId: response.id,
      ephemeralKeySecret: response.ephemeral_key_secret,
      brandLogo: Image.resolveAssetSource(logo),
    };
  };

  const { status, present, loading } = useStripeIdentity(fetchOptions);

  const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
    present();
  }, [present]);

  const renderButton = useCallback(() => {
    if (loading) {
      return <ActivityIndicator />;
    }
    return <Button title="Verify Identity" onPress={handlePress} />;
  }, [loading, handlePress]);

  return (
    <View>
      <View>{renderButton()}</View>
      <Text>Status: {status}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## init and present methods

If you don't want to use `useStripeIdentity` hook, you can also use these 2 methods to create your own implementation:

`init` method for initialization, if you want to use it, you need to pass options (sessionId,
ephemeralKeySecret, brandLogo) from your verification session to it:

```tsx
import { init } from 'stripe-identity-react-native';
import logo from './assets/logo.png';

const customInit = async () => {
  const credentials = await fetchVerificationSessionParams();

  const options = {
    sessionId: credentials.id,
    ephemeralKeySecret: credentials.ephemeral_key_secret,
    brandLogo: Image.resolveAssetSource(logo),
  };

  init(options);
};
```

`present` method will return an object with status: 'Completed' | 'Canceled' | 'Failed':

```tsx
import { present } from 'stripe-identity-react-native';

const customPresent = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await present();

    return result.status;
  } catch (e) {
    return 'Failed';
  }
};
```

## Types

There are two types available: Options and IdentityStatus, you can import these in your TypeScript project directly from Stripe Identity React Native SDK:

```tsx
import type { Options, IdentityStatus } from 'stripe-identity-react-native';
```

## Run the example app

- Run this command from root folder
  - `yarn bootstrap`
- Run example app on a specific device
  - `yarn example ios`
  - or
  - `yarn example android`
